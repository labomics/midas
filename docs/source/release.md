## **Version 0.1.x**

### **v0.1.13** (2025-08-28)
*   **📚 Documentation**
    *   Enhanced and clarified tutorials for a better user learning experience.

### **v0.1.12** (2025-07-03)
*   **✨ Enhancements**
    *   Updated the source for fetching pre-trained models to ensure reliability.

### **v0.1.10** (2025-07-02)
*   **✨ Enhancements**
    *   Adjusted default layer dimensions for the ATAC encoder/decoder (`dims_before_enc_atac=[128, 32]` and `dims_after_dec_atac=[32, 128]`) to improve model performance.

### **v0.1.9** (2025-06-23)
*   **⚙️ Miscellaneous**
    *   Updated the minimum required Python version to `>=3.10`.

### **v0.1.8** (2025-06-12)
*   **🚀 New Features**
    *   Added support for the `.mtx` (Matrix Market) input format for broader data compatibility.
    *   Introduced live UMAP visualization during training via TensorBoard. This can be enabled with `MIDAS.configure_data_from_dir(viz_umap_tb=True)`.
    *   Added a new utility function `data.download_models()` to easily fetch pre-trained models.
*   **✨ Enhancements**
    *   The `MIDAS.predict()` method now returns prediction results directly, improving efficiency and making it easier to chain operations.
    *   Updated the demonstration dataset with more relevant examples.
*   **🐛 Bug Fixes**
    *   Fixed a critical bug that prevented the optimizer from being re-initialized after loading a checkpoint with `MIDAS.load_checkpoint()`.
*   **📚 Documentation**
    *   Updated and expanded documentation and tutorials to reflect recent changes.

### **v0.1.7** (2025-01-22)
*   **🐛 Bug Fixes**
    *   Resolved a bug reported in Issue #22.

### **v0.1.6** (2025-01-20)
*   **🐛 Bug Fixes**
    *   Fixed a bug where the `dims_brefore_enc_atac` configuration was applied incorrectly. It is now conditionally used only when multiple ATAC input dimensions are provided.

### **v0.1.5** (2025-01-17)
*   **🐛 Bug Fixes**
    *   Fixed an issue where Gaussian sampling was incorrectly performed during inference for modality-specific embeddings, leading to more deterministic outputs.

### **v0.1.4** (2024-12-31)
*   **🐛 Bug Fixes**
    *   Corrected the data loading logic in `MIDAS.get_emb_umap()` by fixing the `load_predicted()` utility.

### **v0.1.3** (2024-12-21)
*   **🚀 New Features**
    *   Integrated with **PyTorch Lightning** to enable streamlined multi-GPU training.
    *   Integrated with **TensorBoard** to facilitate real-time visualization of training and validation losses.
    *   Refactored the `MIDAS` architecture to support easier integration of new custom modalities.

### **v0.0.17** (2024-07-16)
*   **🚀 New Features**
    *   Added the `eval_mod()` function for modality evaluation.
