# Installation

To ensure compatibility with **Python v3.12.7** and **Lightning v2.4.0**, we recommend creating a new environment using **conda** to avoid conflicts with existing setups.

## Step 1: Create a New Environment

Run the following command to create a new environment named `scmidas`:

```bash
conda create -n scmidas python=3.12.7
```

Activate the environment:

```bash
conda activate scmidas
```

## Step 2: Install scmidas

**Option 1: Install via pip**

Use `pip` to install the package:

```bash
pip install scmidas
```

**Option 2: Install via conda**

Alternatively, you can install the package directly using conda:

```bash
conda install scmidas
```

**You're All Set!**

Once the installation is complete, you're ready to proceed to the next steps in the guide.
