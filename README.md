conda activate scmidas
conda install scmidas
```

or:

```bash
pip install scmidas
```

## ðŸ”¥New

> - MIDAS supports not only RNA, ADT, and ATAC data but also allows seamless integration of additional modalities with straightforward configuration.
>
> - Leverages PyTorch Lightning for efficient training, including advanced strategies such as distributed data parallel (DDP).
>
> - Integrates with TensorBoard for real-time visualization and tracking of training metrics, such as loss.
